--create a user in mysql

CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

--Grants permisions/privileges
GRANT SELECT ON dbs.tables TO user@localhost;

-- * is used to represent multiple items instead of coma separated values

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO user@host;

It seems to me that sql scripts has its own codestyle like betty, pycodestyle, semistandard etc.
