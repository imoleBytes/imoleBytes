ORM is a way to connect to a database, perform queries, and other sql operations from your programs without directly using SQL. 

One of the orm for python programs is SQLAlchemy. 

here is a the step to use it:
1. create a class that inherit from a Base class. 
the class represent the table. and the class attributes represent the fields/columns.

class Student(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'students'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)
    name = Column(String)

2.use create_engine to create a connection.

engine = create_engine("mysql+mysqldb://user:passwd@host:port/db")

Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

Session = sessionmaker(engine)
session = Session()

results = session.query(Student).all()

others
session.query(Student).filter(Student.name.like('%jon%')
etc
